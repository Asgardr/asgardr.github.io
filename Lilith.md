### Summary

**Lilith: Rise of the Fallen** is my Master's Thesis for my Master's Degree in Video Game Porgramming at the UCM, where I worked with a group of programmers, desingers, artists and producers to create this game.

Lilith takes inspiration in games like Vampire Survivors, Death Must Die and 20 Minutes Till Dawn, where the player has to survive hordes of enemies while it upgrades his abilities and unlockes new ones that attack the enemies automatically. In Lilith we decided to amplify the gameplay of this types of games, adding a new mecanic of corruption similar to Splatoon, where the player has to "paint" as much of the map as possible to win.
