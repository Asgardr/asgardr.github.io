### Summary

**Breathdown** is 2D narrative game made with Unity where you will explore the mysteries hidden in a submerged shopping mall and have to survive before the air escapes from your lungs.

Breathdown was recognised as the game with best art at Madrid.

The intention with Breathdown was to create a terrifying and oppressive experience in which the player must avoid various obstacles between levels and avoid running out of oxygen. Between levels, the player will encounter a mysterious figure who will ask them various questions about their goals, the place, or life.

The further they advance, the more difficult it becomes, and the location will start to glitch and become increasingly surreal, affecting gameplay and conversations with this mysterious figure.

### Contribution

In this project, I acted as a programmer and technical artist. My main contributions were:

  - **CRT and water shaders** implemented with Unity's shader graph tool.
  - Oxygen scripts, oxygen loss, and collisions with the scene.
  - Camera implementation, side scroll and camera shake.
  - Level implementation and edition.
