### Summary

With this project, I am learning how to develop a video game engine from scratch in C++. Following the magnificent work of TheCherno in his Hazel Engine series, I have learned the different features that make up a graphics engine. I have deepened my knowledge of OpenGL and its different libraries such as GLFW, glm, and GLAD, and I have learned how to manage and dispatch events and implement ImGui.

As of now, I have managed to create an orthographic camera, develop the Renderer flow, and create my first triangles.
